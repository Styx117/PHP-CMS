Delete Pseudocode:

Start Session
Link to Database
link to "errorLog.php"

if session_variable("name") is null then
	Redirect user to Login.php


if session_variable("AType") is not "Admin" then
	Redirect user to index.php

print "Currently selected: " + cookie_variable("current")

if post_variable("submit") is set AND cooki_variable(current) is not "None" then
	scr = cookie_variable("selected")
	stmt = "DELETE pages WHERE id = 'sct'"

	if stmt works then
		print "Pages successfully deleted"
		make_cookie("current" = none)
		redirect user to "index.php"

	else
		print "Something went wrong. Page wasn't deleted" + error
